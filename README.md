# JAVA Test for University System
This is a University System in Java by the instruction from my teacher Thomas, and it is also a playground for me to practice Git and GitHub(maybe) for me.

After this, I will try other language like C++ or Python to do the same thing. Next time maybe a hotel management system or something like it.

## My goal for practice
* Practice JAVA in [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)
* Using Git
* Write a good commit
* Markdown grammar(is this word correct?)

If I missed anything form this practice, just take a new issue. Thank you a lot for help!
